## Analysis Task
You are expected to develop one or more interactive visualisation app(s) to answer these three questions. You can have one app for each question, or answer all three questions in one app. Each app can have one or more (linked) visualisations. Here are two example apps, and you are not allowed to reuse their design or code: [example1](https://visualdata.wustl.edu/varepository/VAST%20Challenge%202019/challenges/Mini-Challenge%201/entries/Institute%20for%20the%20Promotion%20of%20Teaching%20Science%20and%20Technology/) and [example2](https://idatavisualizationlab.github.io/N/VAST19/mc1/TTU-Vuong-MC1/index.htm).

### Task 1
Emergency responders will base their initial response on the earthquake shake map. Use visual analytics to determine how their response should change based on damage reports from citizens on the ground. How would you prioritize neighborhoods for response? Which parts of the city are hardest hit?
### Task 2
Use visual analytics to show uncertainty in the data. Compare the reliability of neighborhood reports. Which neighborhoods are providing reliable reports? Provide a rationale for your response.
### Task 3
How do conditions change over time? How does uncertainty in change over time? Describe the key changes you see.
