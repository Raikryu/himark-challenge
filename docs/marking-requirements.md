# Marking and report information
The final deliverable is an implementation of the proposed solution (code repositories) and a report with **maximum 3,000 words** (not including the visualisations). There is no limit on the number of images included in the report.

## The report should cover:
- **Methods/Design**:
    1. A detailed explanation of the techniques and algorithms you used to solve the problem (including data pre-processing)
    2. The rationale behind the visualisation and system interface design (storyboard, etc.).
- **Tool/Implementation**:
    1. A detailed description of all the visualisations (such as different charts included in the tool) and interactive features with screenshots
    2. A detailed explanations on how you implement the visualisation (must include the details of all the libraries used).
- **Results**: detailed description of your visualisations and the answers to the three analysis tasks listed above.
- **Reflection/Future Work**:
    1. A reflection on the project, what went well and what did, covering both the technical (such as the charts used and their implementations) and non-technical aspect (such as project management),
    2. What is still missing/can be improved and how these could be added/further enhanced.
- **Appendix**: an optional appendix should include all the information needed to run the tool, such as what external libraries are need and any configurations.

## Marking Criteria

### Methods/Design (30%)
- The effectiveness and sophistication of the data pre-processing and analysis algorithms.
- The justification of the visualisation and interaction design based on data characteristics and analysis task.

### Tool/Implementation (30%)

- The sophistication and novelty of the design; new visual representations (first of its kind) and interactive dashboard are highly recommended.
- The app architecture, implementation complexity, app robustness, and interaction responsiveness.

### Results (10%)

- How clear the answer is from the visualisation.
- The accuracy of the answer.

### Reflection/Future Work (10%)

- The reflection should be in depth and cover all the aspects of the project.
- The future work should cover all the weaknesses of the current app(s), both visual design and implementation, and the proposed solution should be effective and novel.

### Presentation (20%)
- You will also need to record a presentation of your work of about 10 minutes, which should cover all the main aspects of the report (the first four bullet points above). Provide clear reference to the report where it is not possible to include all the details in the presentation.

Presentation submission:
- A copy of the presentation slides.
- A video of the visualisation app demonstration: maximum 10 minutes, in the mp4 format, no more than 250 MB
